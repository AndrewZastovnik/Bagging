# Bagging
Code for MATH 257 bagging presentation

The regression examples covered by Navid can be found in `bagging_regression_examples.R`. Note: there is an additional classification example applying logistic regression and bagging to the known iris dataset that was not included in the presentation.

The MNIST decision tree classification example can be found in `Bagging.ipynb`.

The `wikipedia_bagging.R` file reproduces the example found on the [Bagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_aggregating) Wikipedia page. This example applies LOESS to ozone data.
